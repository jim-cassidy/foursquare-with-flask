# Foursquare Flask

## Introduction

    A while back, I dediced to focus on a new direction with computers.  I have decided to
work with a mathematical-related field.  So I chose data science.  I got certified with IBM shortly
after.  This gave me a nice foundation.  During the course, I learned about Foursquare.  I have decided
to go further and experiment with this.  So this project was born!

## What is Foursquare?

    Foursquare is a program that stores information about a geographical area.  This data can be queried
over the internet, for example, with python.  If I wanted to search for the best pizza places in Brooklyn,
this is a useful tool.  If I wanted to search for how many schools are in a ten mile radius of a certain
lattitude and longiture, that can also be done.
